I developed the **Accolade AI website** for a client using the Astro framework, TypeScript, and CSS with BEM methodology. The project focused on creating a modern and responsive web presence that is both user-friendly and easy to maintain. Here are some of the key features of the website:
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.accolade.ai" target="_blank" class="text-lblue">Live site</a>
<br>
<br>

- **<i class="fas fa-mobile-alt text-lblue"></i> Responsive Design:** The website adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **<i class="fas fa-envelope text-lblue"></i> Newsletter Subscription:** Visitors can easily subscribe to the newsletter, allowing them to stay updated with the latest content and announcements.
- **<i class="fas fa-pagination text-lblue"></i> Pagination:** Smooth navigation is provided through pagination, enabling users to browse through content efficiently.
- **<i class="fas fa-file-alt text-lblue"></i> Markdown Integration:** Content management is simplified by using Markdown files for newsletters and featured stories, making updates quick and hassle-free.
- **<i class="fas fa-plus-square text-lblue"></i> Accordion Feature:** An accordion component is implemented to organize and display content in a collapsible format, enhancing the user experience by allowing users to expand or collapse sections of content as needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  This project is ongoing, with continuous additions of new pages and features to enhance the website's functionality and user engagement.
