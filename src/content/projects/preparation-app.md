I've developed a simple **Preparation App** for our church organization. This full-stack web application is designed to streamline the process of preparation for various church activities.
<br>
<br>

**Features:**

- **<i class="fab fa-node-js text-lblue"></i> Node.js with Express Backend:** The backend is powered by Node.js with Express, providing a robust and scalable environment for handling server-side operations.
- **<i class="fas fa-database text-lblue"></i> MongoDB for Data Storage:** All data, including user information and preparation themes, is securely stored in a MongoDB database, ensuring efficient data retrieval and management.
- **<i class="fas fa-file-code text-lblue"></i> EJS Templating:** The app uses EJS for rendering dynamic HTML pages, making it easy to integrate data into the user interface.
- **<i class="fas fa-paint-brush text-lblue"></i> CSS for Styling:** The frontend is styled using CSS, offering a clean and user-friendly design.
- **<i class="fas fa-lock text-lblue"></i> User Authentication and Session Management:** The app includes user signup and login features, with session management handled via Express-session. Session data is stored in the database, and session IDs are maintained in browser cookies for user authentication.
- **<i class="fas fa-shield-alt text-lblue"></i> Security Enhancements:** Security is a top priority, with features like Content Security Policy (CSP) implemented through Node Helmet, and CSRF protection to prevent cross-site request forgery.
  <br>
  <br>
- **<i class="fas fa-user-check  text-lblue"></i> Test Login Credentials:** You can log in
  using the following test credentials:
  - **Email:** <span class="text-lblue">test123@gmail.com</span>
  - **Password:** <span class="text-lblue">Test123</span>
  - **Theme Passcode:** <span class="text-lblue">asdf</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    _Note: The app is hosted on a free tier of Render.com, so it may take a moment for the initial load._
    <br>
    <br>
    This app serves as a helpful tool for our church community, simplifying the preparation process while ensuring secure and efficient management of user data.
