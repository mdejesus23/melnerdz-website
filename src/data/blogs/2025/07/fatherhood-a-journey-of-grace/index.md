I come from a broken family—a background that left deep wounds in my heart. Growing up, I wasn’t the best son to my mother. I felt lost and without direction. My teenage years were shaped by bad influences. I had friends involved in selling marijuana at school, some carried weapons, and many were often in trouble. With that kind of environment, I believed there was no hope for change in my life.

But thanks be to God—He called us into a Christian community through our parish. It began with my mother’s conversion, and eventually, I found myself drawn in as well. At first, I felt out of place. Most of the people my age in the community seemed to come from whole, loving families—something I never had. But slowly, through their guidance and the work of God’s grace, I began to change.

The community taught me how to live differently. I began to understand what it means to be a better father to my children and a better husband to my wife—two roles that are deeply interconnected. Healing began as I embraced a new way of life rooted in faith.

Often, as fathers, we measure our worth by what we do—how much we earn, what we can provide, or how successful we appear. And when we fall short because of life’s challenges or our own weaknesses, we feel like failures.

But fatherhood is not defined by our ability to provide materially alone. Rather, it is rooted in our relationship with our children. Our presence, our guidance, our love—that’s what truly matters. These are the foundations of being a good father.

Ultimately, God the Father is the true provider. We are only shadows of His perfect fatherhood. He is the one who meets all our children’s needs, even when we cannot. And in recognizing this, we are freed from the pressure of perfection and can embrace our role with humility and trust.

I encourage you, especially fellow fathers, to pray to St. Joseph—the humble, earthly father of Jesus. St. Joseph was not rich or powerful, but he trusted deeply in God. He accepted his role with quiet strength and passed on the faith that has saved us all.

Like St. Joseph, may we learn to be fathers who rely on God, who lead with love, and who shape our children not through wealth or success—but through faith, integrity, and presence.
