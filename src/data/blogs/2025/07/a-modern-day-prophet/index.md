In the Old Testament, we often read about the writings of prophets—figures like Joel, Amos, and others who are considered _minor prophets_. However, their designation as "minor" does not imply that their prophecies are any less significant than those of prophets like Isaiah.

Their messages frequently contain warnings about the "Day of the Lord," a theme many Church Fathers interpret as referring to the final judgment. At first glance, these prophecies may seem filled with threats of punishment. But if we delve deeper, we discover that they are ultimately messages of **hope and love** for God’s chosen people.

Yahweh desired that the Israelites return to Him with their whole hearts so they could prosper and enter the Promised Land. His calls to repentance were always rooted in love and a desire for reconciliation.

Today, I believe that modern-day prophets still exist. They may be our **catechists**, **priests**, **parents**, or even our **brothers and sisters in the faith community**—people who are willing to correct us when we go astray. Although correction is often difficult to accept, and can sometimes blind us to the voice of the Lord, it is an act of love and grace.

Let us ask the Lord for the grace to recognize our faults, and to have **meek and humble hearts** that can accept correction with hope. In doing so, we allow ourselves to be transformed and grow in holiness.

**A Prayer**

\> Lord, help us to be humble before the words of the prophets,

\> so that we may repent and experience true conversion of heart.

\> We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen.
