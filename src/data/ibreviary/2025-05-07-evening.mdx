<section><p>BreviaryEvening PrayerINTRODUCTIONGod,+come to my assistance.—Lord, make haste to help me.Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:—as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen. Alleluia.HYMNAlternate HymnsAs we await the Lamb’s high feastin snow-white robes of saving grace,we sing to Christ, our Prince and Head,for we have crossed the Red Sea tide.His holy Body, parched and searedupon the altar of the Cross,his crimson Blood, outpoured for us,we taste and so we live for God.Protected on the paschal evefrom devastating angel sword,we were delivered and set freefrom Pharaoh’s harsh and bitter rule.And now, our Pasch is Christ himself,the pure and spotless Lamb once slain,unleavened bread of truthfulness,who gives his flesh in sacrifice.O worthy Victim, real and true,who rends and breaks the pow’r of hell,the captives there have been redeemedand now enjoy the prize of life.Christ rises from the tomb indeed,triumphant Victor from the depths,who thrusts the tyrant down in chainsand clears the way to Paradise.O Jesus, be for mind and heartour everlasting paschal joyand gather us, reborn by grace,to share your triumphs evermore.To you, Lord Jesus, glory be,who shine in vict’ry over death,with God the Father, ever blest,and loving Spirit, ever one.

Amen.Tune: DUKE STREET, as above, or Mode IV, melody 86;Liber Hymnarius, Solesmes, 1983*Text:O rex æternæ, Domine, 5̀-6th c., © 2023 ICELPSALMODYAnt. 1Your sorrow will be turned into joy, alleluia.Psalm 126Joyful hope in GodJust as you share in sufferings so you will share in the divine glory(2 Corinthians 1:7).When the Lord delivered Zion from bondage,*it seemed like a dream.Then was our mouth filled with laughter,*on our lips there were songs.The heathens themselves said: “What marvels*the Lord worked for them!”What marvels the Lord worked for us!*Indeed we were glad.Deliver us, O Lord, from our bondage*as streams in dry land.Those who are sowing in tears*will sing when they reap.They go out, they go out, full of tears,*carrying seed for the sowing:they come back, they come back, full of song,*carrying their sheaves.Glory to the Father, and to the Son,*and to the Holy Spirit:as it was in the beginning, is now,*and will be for ever. Amen.Psalm PrayerLord, you have raised us from the earth; may you let the seeds of justice, which we have sown in tears, grow and increase in your sight. May we reap in joy the harvest we hope for patiently.Ant.Your sorrow will be turned into joy, alleluia.Ant. 2Whether we live or die, we are the Lord’s, alleluia.Psalm 127Apart from God our labors are worthlessYou are God’s building(1 Corinthians 3:9).If the Lord does not build the house,*in vain do its builders labor;if the Lord does not watch over the city,*in vain does the watchman keep vigil.In vain is your earlier rising,*your going later to rest,you who toil for the bread you eat:*when he pours gifts on his beloved while they slumber.Truly sons are a gift from the Lord,*a blessing, the fruit of the womb.Indeed the sons of youth*are like arrows in the hand of a warrior.O the happiness of the man*who has filled his quiver with these arrows!He will have no cause for shame*when he disputes with his foes in the gateways.Glory to the Father, and to the Son,*and to the Holy Spirit:as it was in the beginning, is now,*and will be for ever. Amen.Psalm PrayerYou command the seed to rise, Lord God, though the farmer is unaware. Grant that those who labor for you may trust not in their own work but in your help. Remembering that the land is brought to flower not with human tears but with those of your Son, may the Church rely only upon your gifts.Ant.Whether we live or die, we are the Lord’s, alleluia.Ant. 3From him, through him, and in him all things exist; glory to him for ever, alleluia.Canticle: Colossians 1:12-20Christ the first-born of all creation and the first-born from the deadLet us give thanks to the Father*for having made you worthyto share the lot of the saints*in light.He rescued us*from the power of darknessand brought us*into the kingdom of his beloved Son.Through him we have redemption,*the forgiveness of our sins.He is the image of the invisible God,*the first-born of all creatures.In him everything in heaven and on earth was created,*things visible and invisible.All were created through him;*all were created for him.He is before all else that is.*In him everything continues in being.It is he who is head of the body, the church!*he who is the beginning,the first-born of the dead,*so that primacy may be his in everything.It pleased God to make absolute fullness reside in him*and, by means of him, to reconcile everything in his person,both on earth and in the heavens,*making peace through the blood of his cross.Glory to the Father, and to the Son,*and to the Holy Spirit:as it was in the beginning, is now,*and will be for ever. Amen.Ant.From him, through him, and in him all things exist; glory to him for ever, alleluia.READINGHebrews 7:24-27Jesus, because he remains forever, has a priesthood that does not pass away. Therefore he is always able to save those who approach God through him, since he forever lives to make intercession for them. It was fitting that we should have such a high priest: holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, higher than the heavens. Unlike the other high priests, he has no need to offer sacrifice day after day, first for his own sins and then for those of the people; he did that once for all when he offered himself.RESPONSORYThe disciples rejoiced, alleluia, alleluia.—The disciples rejoiced, alleluia, alleluia.When they saw the risen Lord,—alleluia, alleluia.Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.—The disciples rejoiced, alleluia, alleluia.GOSPEL CANTICLEAnt.All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I shall not turn away, alleluia.Canticle of MaryLuke 1:46-55The soul rejoices in the LordMy+soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,†my spirit rejoices in God my Savior*for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.From this day all generations will call me blessed:†the Almighty has done great things for me,*and holy is his Name.He has mercy on those who fear him*in every generation.He has shown the strength of his arm,*he has scattered the proud in their conceit.He has cast down the mighty from their thrones,*and has lifted up the lowly.He has filled the hungry with good things,*and the rich he has sent away empty.He has come to the help of his servant Israel*for he has remembered his promise of mercy,the promise he made to our fathers,*to Abraham and his children for ever.Glory to the Father, and to the Son,*and to the Holy Spirit:as it was in the beginning, is now,*and will be for ever. Amen.Ant.All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I shall not turn away, alleluia.INTERCESSIONSChrist rose from the dead and is seated at the right hand of the Father. Let us pray to him, saying:Lord Jesus, you live for ever; hear our prayer.Lord, remember all who minister in your service,—may their holy lives be an example to your people.Lord Jesus, you live for ever; hear our prayer.Give to those who govern us the spirit of justice and peace,—so that the human family may live in harmony.Lord Jesus, you live for ever; hear our prayer.Guide our days in the way of salvation,—and fill the earth with your plenty for the sake of the needy.Lord Jesus, you live for ever; hear our prayer.Christ our Savior, light of the world, you have called creation from death to life,—may your light shine for ever on our departed brothers and sisters.Lord Jesus, you live for ever; hear our prayer.THE LORD’S PRAYER(Gathering our prayer and praises into one, let us offer the prayer Christ himself taught us:)Our Father who art in heaven,hallowed be thy name;thy kingdom come,thy will be doneon earth, as it is in heaven.Give us this day our daily bread,and forgive us our trespasses,as we forgive those who trespass against us,and lead us not into temptation,but deliver us from evil.CONCLUDING PRAYERMerciful Lord,hear the prayers of your people.May we who have received your gift of faithshare for ever in the new life of Christ.Grant this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,God, for ever and ever.—Amen.Or:Be present to your family, O Lord, we pray,and graciously ensurethose you have endowed with the grace of faithan eternal share in the Resurrection of your Only Begotten Son.Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,God, for ever and ever.—Amen.DISMISSALIf a priest or deacon presides, he dismisses the people:The Lord be with you.—And with your spirit.May almighty God bless you,the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.—Amen.Another form of the blessing may be used, as at Mass.Then he adds:Go in peace.—Thanks be to God.In the absence of a priest or deacon and in individual recitation, Evening Prayer concludes:May the Lord+bless us,protect us from all eviland bring us to everlasting life.—Amen.******DONATEto support the continued development of the iBreviarySUBSCRIBEiBreviary newsletterAlleluia!
