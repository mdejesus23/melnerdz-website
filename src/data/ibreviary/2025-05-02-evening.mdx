God’s flock is in your midst; give it a shepherd’s care. Watch over it willingly, as God would have you do, not under constraint, and not for shameful profit, either, but generously. Be examples to the flock, not lording it over those assigned to you, so that when the chief Shepherd appears, you will win for yourselves the unfading crown of glory.RESPONSORYThis is a man who loved his brethren and ever prayed for them, alleluia, alleluia.—This is a man who loved his brethren and ever prayed for them, alleluia, alleluia.He spent himself in their service,—alleluia, alleluia.Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.—This is a man who loved his brethren and ever prayed for them, alleluia, alleluia.GOSPEL CANTICLEAnt.

We honor him and in our weakness we pray:Bring salvation to your people, Lord.You marvelously illuminated your Church through distinguished leaders and holy men and women,—let Christians rejoice always in such splendor.Bring salvation to your people, Lord.You forgave the sins of your people when their holy leaders like Moses sought your compassion,—through their intercession continue to purify and sanctify your holy people.Bring salvation to your people, Lord.In the midst of their brothers and sisters you anointed your holy ones and filled them with the Holy Spirit,—fill all the leaders of your people with the same Spirit.Bring salvation to your people, Lord.You yourself are the only visible possession of our holy pastors,—let none of them, won at the price of your blood, remain far from you.Bring salvation to your people, Lord.The shepherds of your Church keep your flock from being snatched out of your hand. Through them you give your flock eternal life,—save those who have died, those for whom you gave up your life.Bring salvation to your people, Lord.THE LORD’S PRAYER(Gathering our prayer and praises into one, let us offer the prayer Christ himself taught us:)Our Father, who art in heaven,hallowed be thy name;thy kingdom come,thy will be doneon earth as it is in heaven.Give us this day our daily bread;and forgive us our trespassesas we forgive those who trespass against us;and lead us not into temptation,but deliver us from evil.CONCLUDING PRAYERFather,you raised up Saint Athanasiusto be an outstanding defenderof the truth of Christ’s divinity.By his teaching and protectionmay we grow in your knowledge and love.Grant this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Sonwho lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,God, forever and ever.—Amen.Or:Almighty, ever-living God,who raised up the Bishop Saint Athanasiusas an outstanding champion of your Son’s divinity,mercifully grant,that, rejoicing in his teaching and protection,we may never cease to grow in knowledge and love of you.Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Sonwho lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,God, forever and ever.—Amen.DISMISSALIf a priest or deacon presides, he dismisses the people:The Lord be with you.—And with your spirit.May almighty God bless you,the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.—Amen.Another form of the blessing may be used, as at Mass.Then he adds:Go in peace.—Thanks be to God.In the absence of a priest or deacon and in individual recitation, Evening Prayer concludes:May the Lord+bless us,protect us from all eviland bring us to everlasting life.—Amen.******DONATEto support the continued development of the iBreviarySUBSCRIBEiBreviary newsletterShepherd of souls, in love come, feed us,Life-giving Bread for hungry hearts!To those refreshing waters lead usWhere dwells the peace your grace imparts.May we, the wayward in your fold,By your forgiveness rest consoled.Life-giving vine, come feed and nourish,Strengthen each branch with life divine;Ever in you O may we flourishFruitful the branches on the vine.Lord, may our souls be purifiedSo that in Christ may we abide.Sinful is man who kneels before you,Worthy of you are you alone;Yet in your name do we implore you,Rich are the mercies you have shown.Say but the word, O Lord divine,Then are our hearts made pure like thine.Tune: Aus Heilige Seelenlust 98.98.88Music: George Joseph, 1657Text: Omar Westendorf © World Library Publications.
