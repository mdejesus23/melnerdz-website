Amen. Alleluia.HYMNAlternate HymnsAs we await the Lamb’s high feastin snow-white robes of saving grace,we sing to Christ, our Prince and Head,for we have crossed the Red Sea tide.His holy Body, parched and searedupon the altar of the Cross,his crimson Blood, outpoured for us,we taste and so we live for God.Protected on the paschal evefrom devastating angel sword,we were delivered and set freefrom Pharaoh’s harsh and bitter rule.And now, our Pasch is Christ himself,the pure and spotless Lamb once slain,unleavened bread of truthfulness,who gives his flesh in sacrifice.O worthy Victim, real and true,who rends and breaks the pow’r of hell,the captives there have been redeemedand now enjoy the prize of life.Christ rises from the tomb indeed,triumphant Victor from the depths,who thrusts the tyrant down in chainsand clears the way to Paradise.O Jesus, be for mind and heartour everlasting paschal joyand gather us, reborn by grace,to share your triumphs evermore.To you, Lord Jesus, glory be,who shine in vict’ry over death,with God the Father, ever blest,and loving Spirit, ever one.
