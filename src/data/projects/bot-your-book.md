---

**Bot Your Book** is an innovative SaaS platform designed for authors and creators who want to transform passive book readers into active email subscribers—without landing pages or complicated funnels.

With a single script embed, you can deploy a personalized AI chatbot trained on your book’s content. Readers engage with the bot naturally—asking real questions and receiving helpful answers—while being gently encouraged to join your email list at the perfect moment.

> **Note:** This project is currently in its MVP stage. Features and integrations are evolving rapidly.

## 💡 What Is It?

Instead of sending readers to a static form, **Bot Your Book** lets them:

- Chat with a bot trained on your **book or notes**
- Ask questions like they would in conversation
- Get answers drawn from your actual content
- Be nudged to **subscribe**, right when trust is highest

No tech headaches. Just **copy, paste, and grow**.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **📘 Trained on Your Book**  
  Upload your manuscript, notes, or draft. The bot learns from your content to answer questions accurately.

- **💬 Conversational List Building**  
  As readers ask questions, the bot builds trust—then invites them to join your email list in a natural, non-pushy way.

- **📥 Email List Integration**  
  Export subscribers to CSV or connect with tools like **Mailchimp**, **Zapier**, and more.

- **🎨 Custom Branding**  
  Tailor the bot's avatar, tone, fonts, and colors to match your author brand.

- **📈 Insights Dashboard**  
  View real-time metrics: see which questions are asked most, monitor engagement, and track email captures.

- **⚡ Works Everywhere**  
  Embed it with a single line of code or share a hosted bot link. Desktop, tablet, mobile—fully responsive.

- **🎁 Bonus: Instant Reader Insights**  
  Every question becomes valuable data. Learn what readers care about most—perfect for planning future content.
