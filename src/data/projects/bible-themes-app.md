I've developed a full-stack <strong>Bible themes App</strong> for our church organization, built using the **MERN stack**. This application streamlines bible themes activities, making collaboration easier and more efficient.

## Features:

- <i class="fas fa-database text-lblue"></i> MongoDB: The app uses MongoDB as its database for storing and managing data, ensuring fast and reliable access.

- <i class="fab fa-node-js text-lblue"></i> Express.js Backend: The backend is powered by Express.js, offering a robust framework for handling API requests and server-side operations.

- <i class="fab fa-react text-lblue"></i> React Frontend: React powers the frontend, providing a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly interface.

- <i class="fas fa-server text-lblue"></i> Node.js: Node.js serves as the runtime environment for the backend, enabling efficient and scalable server-side processing.

- <i class="fas fa-toolbox text-lblue"></i> State Management with Zustand: Zustand simplifies state management, ensuring efficient and predictable handling of application state.

- <i class="fas fa-sync text-lblue"></i> Data Fetching with React Query: React Query optimizes server state synchronization, improving the app's performance and usability.

- <i class="fas fa-paint-brush text-lblue"></i> TailwindCSS for Styling: TailwindCSS provides a modern, responsive, and utility-first design system for the application.

- <i class="fas fa-link text-lblue"></i> REST API Integration: A RESTful API connects the backend and frontend, enabling seamless communication and data exchange.

- <i class="fas fa-lock text-lblue"></i> JWT-Based Authentication: Authentication is enhanced with JSON Web Tokens (JWT), enabling secure, stateless user sessions and API communication.

- <i class="fas fa-envelope text-lblue"></i> SendGrid Integration for Email Notifications: The app utilizes **SendGrid** to send automated email notifications for user actions such as account creation, password recovery, and other essential updates.

- <i class="fas fa-cloud-upload-alt text-lblue"></i> Cloudinary for Media & EPUB Storage: All uploaded images and EPUB files are stored and managed via **Cloudinary**, ensuring optimized delivery and secure file handling.

- <i class="fas fa-user-check text-lblue"></i> Test Credentials for Easy Access:

  - Email: <span class="text-lblue">test123@gmail.com</span>
  - Password: <span class="text-lblue">Test1234</span>
  - Theme Passcode: <span class="text-lblue">asdf</span>
